## General Info ##

I created this game while completing a course on Codecademy, it is a game that can be played from the terminal.

The program generates a game field with holes and a hat. Your objective to navigate using keywords 'u','d','r','l' to 
the hat without stepping on the holes or retracing your steps.

## Technologies ##

* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Setup ##
Install prompt-sync by typing the command `npm install prompt-sync` in your terminal.
Download the main.js file and use `node main.js` in the terminal to run it.

## Status ##

I have closed the project for now. Any suggestions to make it even more fun are more than welcome!
